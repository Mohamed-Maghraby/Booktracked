## What I learned

- Starting to work with react.js and toggling challenging situation and handling complex UI/UX.

- Getting starting with node.js and expresses as a server side development solution

- To create REST API's using node.js which is challenging.

- DBMS with MySQL, and node.js querying options with SQL

- Discovering public codebases from github to integrate in my project

- Understanding how some library works underwood like react-reader

- Made me think that there are bottlenecks and limits to such projects and I need to think about scalability, and some technologies are not good for bigger project, EX: I didn't think about performance optimization and state management, when I started but at the end of the project that was a must and the project now 
of course need to be improved. and point is I know how to do so


## ‚ú® Future Enhancements

- Add dark mode
- Implement full EPUB.js reader
- AI-powered personalized reading suggestions and book summarization
- Tailwind.css instead of native CSS
- Integrating UI library like Shadcn
- State management library like Redux
- React-Query for fetching 
- React Hook Form to handle forms
- Enhancing authentication with auth library like Auth0


## Finally 

I could of figure out those spaces for enhancements by developing, searching, analyzing, and documenting. This project helped me to think about real world development solutions and what I should learn to level up my skills for the next project and to be read for the job market
