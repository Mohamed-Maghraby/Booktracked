- Getting starting with node.js and expresses as a server side development solution

- To create REST API's using node.js which is challenging.

- DBMS with MySQL, and node.js querying options with SQL

- Discovering public codebases from github to integrate in my project

- To understand how some library works underwood like react-reader
